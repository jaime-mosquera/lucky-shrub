The website must have: the logo at the top (inside a `<header>` tag); a navigation bar just below it (inside a `<nav>` tag), with four elements; the main body, which must have a full-width box in the upper half, and be split in three in the lower half; and a footer divided in two equal parts (the logo again but smaller, and the copyright notice).

The boxes can be created with Flexbox or Grid.
