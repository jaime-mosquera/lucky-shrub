A small website (just front-end) for a hypothetical garden design firm, developed as the final project of Meta's "HTML and CSS in depth" course.

## License
The logos used for this website were provided by Meta for the course, and I claim no copyright over them.

The other images, and the placeholder text, was generated by ChatGPT.
